# 2D Array Board Game Project

## Overview
In this project, you will create an interactive board game using 2D arrays. While a simple template is provided, you are encouraged to be creative and design your own game! Some possible games you could create include:
- Battleship
- Connect Four
- Minesweeper
- Snake
- Maze Runner
- 2048
- Your own original game!

## Learning Objectives
- Master 2D array manipulation
- Practice object-oriented design
- Implement game logic and user interaction
- Handle edge cases and input validation
- Design clear user interfaces

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. Use a 2D array as the game board
2. Implement player moves/turns
3. Display the game board after each move
4. Include win/lose conditions
5. Validate all user inputs
6. Prevent invalid moves (e.g., moving off the board, placing pieces in invalid locations)

### Game Elements
Your game should include at least three of the following:
- Multiple players
- Game pieces or characters
- Obstacles or barriers
- Collectible items
- Score tracking
- Special moves or abilities

## Template Code
A basic template is provided in `BoardGame.java` and `GameRunner.java` that demonstrates:
- Creating and displaying a 2D array board
- Basic player movement
- Game loop structure
- User input handling

Feel free to modify or completely replace this template to suit your game design!

## Development Process
1. **Planning (Day 1)**
   - Choose your game type
   - Design the board layout
   - Plan game mechanics
   - Create class diagrams

2. **Implementation (Days 2-3)**
   - Create the game board
   - Implement basic moves
   - Add game pieces/obstacles
   - Develop win/lose conditions

## Criteria

  * Game works as intended
  * No major bugs
  * Handles invalid inputs gracefully

- Code Quality 
  * Well-organized and readable code
  * Appropriate comments and documentation
  * Efficient algorithms

- Creativity & Features 
  * Unique game elements
  * Engaging gameplay
  * Extra features beyond basic requirements

- Presentation 
  * Clear instructions for players
  * Professional code formatting
  * In-class demonstration
